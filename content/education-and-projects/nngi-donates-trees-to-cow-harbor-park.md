NNGI is proud and excited to announce the donation of two native red maples (Acer rubrum) to Cow Harbor Park by the water in Northport Village. The inspiration for the donation was the fact that some trees may need to come down in the park due to the renovation of the nearby basketball court and public bathroom.

Matt Gorman, one of NNGI’s founders, reached out to Jon Holden of Steven Dubner Landscaping, and a Northport resident, for advice. Jon not only advised as to what kind of tree would be good for the site, he also donated the services of his team to transport and plant the maples.

Northport Village’s Mayor Donna Koch, Trustee Meghan Dolan, Engineer Roland Buzard, and the Parks Department also provided support and assistance with the project. Robb Smith, a landscape architect for the New York State Department of Transportation, who also lives in Northport, provided advice on the optimal placement of the new trees.

Due to the fact that they are native to our area, the red maples will have a positive impact on the park’s biodiversity. They will host beneficial insects and attract songbirds. Although they are currently dormant, they have gorgeous red stems. Their leaves will emerge in the spring and then turn a brilliant red in the fall.

Once the basketball court and bathroom renovations are complete, NNGI will donate two more trees to the park. Once again, our efforts will be coordinated with the Village to decide the optimal type and location for the trees. One idea is to choose trees that will provide trees that can offer some shade to the park’s playground.
