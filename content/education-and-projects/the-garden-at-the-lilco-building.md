Joe Schmitz, the owner of the historical LILCO building in Northport Village contacted NNGI about adding native plants around the building. Due to its location in the heart of town, we jumped at the opportunity. In September of 2022, the space was transformed from an ecologically barren eyesore into a stunning pollinator-friendly garden.

Approximately two dozen volunteers made this extensive project a reality.

Before planting, there was a lot of preparation that needed to happen. Invasive plants were removed (ex: Norway Maple Tree), weeds pulled, and grass areas ripped up. We were all struck by how barren and compacted the soil was and we could see how its lack of permeability contributes to Northportâ€™s rain run-off problem.

In spite of the difficulty of digging into this cement-like turf, over 500 native plants were installed!! Plants were chosen for their visual appeal and their ability to adapt to the site, taking into account sun, moisture, and soil quality. Some examples of plants added to the site are Anise Hyssop, Beardtongue, Coreopsis, Little Henry Itea, and Switchgrass.

You are welcome to visit the garden anytime! It can be found on the corner of Scudder and Woodbine Ave and behind the LILCO building. It provides year-round beauty and pollinator support. Stop by and be inspired!

NNGI would like to extend a special thank you to Joe for providing NNGI with this opportunity with his desire to use native plants to beautify the space. He was right there beside us with his hands in the dirt the whole day!
