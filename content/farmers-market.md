NNGI sets up a booth monthly at the Northport Farmer’s Market in downtown Northport Village. This is a great opportunity to pick up some native plants to enhance the beauty and biodiversity of your home. The booth is also staffed by our resident native plant experts, so come down with your questions!

You can find the NNGI booth right at the foot of Main Street right by the harbor.

NNGI will be there from 8:00am to 12:30pm.
