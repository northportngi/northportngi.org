    header: 'Why Garden with Native Plants & Flowers?'
    copy: 'Native plants are essential to supporting living landscapes across the United States.

    image1_alt: 'This image shows a small, wooden house-shaped structure, mounted on a post, against a wooden fence background. The structure has a triangular roof and two levels. The top level contains several small, hollow bamboo sticks arranged in a bundle. The bottom level also has a bundle of bamboo sticks, along with a small, rectangular object with grid-like lines, possibly a notepad or a small sign. This structure appears to be a bee or insect house, designed to provide shelter for solitary bees or other insects.'

    image2_alt: 'This image shows a close-up of a butterfly perched on a tall, purple flower. The butterfly has orange and black wings with white spots along the edges, resembling a monarch butterfly. The flower has multiple clusters of small, feathery, purple blooms growing along the stem, which appears to be part of a plant with budding flowers at the bottom. The background is blurred, highlighting the butterfly and the flower as the main subjects of the image.'
